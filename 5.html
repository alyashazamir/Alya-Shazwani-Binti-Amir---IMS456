<p><b>Browsing Internet : </b></p>
<p>I love to browse internet to watch videos about random stuff; sometimes it is about entertainment, educational and also skill. The platform that i always visit  are Facebook, Youtube, and Instagram. It actually hepls me to reduce my stress after attending class. One of the best videos that i have watched in Youtube is the Kitchen Nightmare series, it is an entertaining show that highlights the behaviour of people. The host is Gordon Ramsay; a chef. </p>

<p><b>Listening to music : </b></p>
<p>One of my hobbies is listening to music. I love listening to korean pop the most. I really love the music that have been out. A lot of them are experimental and have its own genre or signature of that group. The lyrics are not only talking about love, in fact it has meaningful lyrics that i can relate. The artist that i love are BTS, TXT, and a lot more. Most of their song has great lyrics and variety of genre.</p>

<p><b>Reading Dictionary : </b></p>
<p>It started when i’m in secondary school. I really love to open dictionary casually when i’m bored. So it becomes a hobby. I did wrote all the words in a special vocabulary book, but i don’t do it anymore nowadays. For me, reading dictionary is a fun & quick activity to fill up the time.</p>
